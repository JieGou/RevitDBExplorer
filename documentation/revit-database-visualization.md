## Revit database visualization (RDV)

RDV works for selected element/object in the tree and/or on the list.

Available visualizations:

- model coordinate system displayed at (0,0,0)
- for an Element, its bounding box with marked min and max points
- for a Rebar, its Normal and marked start and end points
- for an XYZ, small coordinate system at that point
- BoundingBoxXYZ,
- bounded Curve, 
- Edge, 
- Point, 
- Soild, 
- PlanarFace
 


**Visualizations are static, they are not automatically updated when element changes.**
